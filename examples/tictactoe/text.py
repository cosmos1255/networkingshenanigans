|   TicTacToe is played by placing either an 'x' or 'o'    |
|   inside of corresponding squares (labeled 1-9). At      |
|   the start of each game, the two players will be        |
|   assigned either an 'x' or 'o' to play. On an           |
|   individual turn, a player will enter the number        |
|   corresponding to the spot on the board that they       |
|   wish to place an 'x' or an 'o'.                        |

|   To win, a player must be the first to get three 'x'    |
|   or 'o' placements in a straight line across, down or   |
|   on the diagonal. A game can also end in a tie where    |
|   neither player wins.                                   |
